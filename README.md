  A Command Line Version of Hangman
</div>

## About
`hangman` is a command line version of the eponymous paper and pencil game where the player guesses the secret word before the stick figure is hung (or the total number of incorrect guesses are exhausted). Gameplay continues until the player has guessed the word correctly or until they run out of guesses (i.e., when stick figure is hung).[^1]

## Self Reflections
- > This project was much harder than the some of [my previous projects](https://github.com/ohgrmait?tab=repositories). The saving game at each turn and loading up the game at the start of the program was a hair pulling experience. Going back to the articles on serialization and deserialization helped a lot - so did [TOP's discord server](https://discord.gg/fbFCkYabZB) and [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Unfortunately, I also got sick at this moment, nonetheless, I managed to pull through and finish it. I loved the whole experience and it was an enticing project.
